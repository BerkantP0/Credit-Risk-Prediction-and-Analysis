## Credit Risk Estimation and Analysis Project
This repository contains a machine learning model developed to evaluate credit applications and predict credit risk for a bank.

# Project Objectives
Data Collection: Utilized the [Credit Risk Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset) from Kaggle or other open data sources containing credit application and repayment data.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Filled missing data, handled anomalies, and converted categorical variables into numerical ones using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Data Exploration and Visualization: Analyzed customer profiles, visualized differences between risky and non-risky customers, and examined credit risk profiles across different customer segments.
Modeling: Built credit risk prediction models using various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting, and XGBoost.
Model Selection and Optimization: Selected the best-performing model and optimized its performance through hyperparameter tuning using methods like Grid Search or Random Search.
Evaluation and Presentation of Results: Presented model outcomes with meaningful reports and visualizations, along with strategic recommendations for the credit assessment process.
